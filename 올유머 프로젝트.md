1. Tried to pull the crawler logic out of server and put it into AWS lambda fuction, but I ran out of the time.

2. Spent 2 months to finish the development and during the half of the time, I struggled with "Bad Code" and refactoring it. It's always good to TDD and write clean code.

3. Sharp library causes problems when you're using it with lambda function. It is recommended to use it with docker.

4. Disparity between "Dev" and "Prod" environment made me struggle more than 3 days. So for next project, I'll use docker and docker-compose.
